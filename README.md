Healthcare Provider Dashboard in Power Bi
# Hospital Provider Dashboard

## Overview
The **Hospital Provider Dashboard** is a Power BI report designed to analyze hospital performance, patient care metrics, financial insights, and provider efficiency. This dashboard enables healthcare administrators, hospital executives, and analysts to make data-driven decisions for optimizing hospital operations and improving patient outcomes.

## Project Structure
The Power BI file consists of multiple report pages, each focusing on different aspects of hospital provider analysis:

### 1. **Dashboard Overview**
   - Provides a high-level summary of key hospital metrics.
   - Displays total patient visits, admission rates, and provider performance indicators.
   - Features KPIs such as bed occupancy rate, average length of stay, and readmission rate.

### 2. **Patient Demographics & Volume Analysis**
   - Analyzes patient demographics, including age, gender, and location.
   - Tracks patient volume trends over time to identify peak periods.
   - Visualizes hospital visit trends categorized by inpatient and outpatient services.

### 3. **Provider Performance Analysis**
   - Evaluates provider efficiency based on patient outcomes and treatment success rates.
   - Tracks individual provider workloads and patient satisfaction ratings.
   - Assesses provider response times and appointment wait times.

### 4. **Financial Performance**
   - Provides insights into hospital revenue streams, costs, and profitability.
   - Breaks down revenue by department, insurance type, and treatment categories.
   - Identifies cost-saving opportunities and financial risks.

### 5. **Hospital Resource Utilization**
   - Analyzes bed occupancy rates and staff allocation.
   - Tracks the utilization of medical equipment and available resources.
   - Identifies bottlenecks in hospital operations and patient flow.

### 6. **Readmission & Mortality Analysis**
   - Tracks patient readmission rates and identifies contributing factors.
   - Monitors hospital mortality rates and compares them against benchmarks.
   - Identifies high-risk patient groups for better intervention strategies.

### 7. **Data Sources**
   - The dataset includes hospital admission records, provider performance metrics, financial statements, and patient satisfaction surveys.
   - Data is aggregated from Electronic Health Records (EHR), insurance claims, and internal hospital management systems.

## Key Insights
- Trends in hospital admissions and patient demographics.
- Provider efficiency metrics to optimize patient care.
- Financial performance trends and revenue optimization opportunities.
- Identification of factors contributing to high readmission rates.
- Strategies for improving resource utilization and hospital capacity planning.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard development.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Custom calculations and KPIs.
- **SQL**: Data extraction and transformation.
- **Excel/CSV**: Data import and preprocessing.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integration with Real-Time Hospital Data**: Live monitoring of hospital operations.
- **AI-Based Predictive Analytics**: Forecasting patient admissions and readmission risks.
- **Advanced Patient Segmentation**: Machine learning models for personalized treatment plans.
- **Enhanced Interactivity**: More drill-through options and self-service analytics.
- **Mobile-Friendly Reports**: Optimized dashboard layouts for mobile access.
